## Problem

Show that $$d = \inf(\mathbf{S})$$ iff $$d$$ is a lower bound for $$\mathbf{S}$$ and for any $$\epsilon > 0$$ there is an $$x \in \mathbf{S}$$ such that $$d \geq x-\epsilon$$

## Solution

### => 
 
+ $$d$$ is lower bound is trivial.
+ Choose $$x = d + \epsilon/2$$, then $$x-\epsilon = d-\epsilon/2 \leq d$$

### <=  

Assume $$d'$$ is another lower bound and $$d' > d$$.

Choose $$\epsilon = (d'-d)/2$$, there is an $$x = d+\epsilon \in \mathbf{S}$$.

But $$x = d+\epsilon = (d'+d)/2 < d' (\Rightarrow\!\Leftarrow),$$ then $$d$$ is max lower bound, i.e. $$d$$ is $$\inf(\mathbf{S})$$
